Note that all the "if False" and "if True" are simply there to
give you the correct success and error message formats.
You can use if sentences or try catch or any other
means of programming you control flow.
You can make an encapsulting class for everything and start with that,
rather than starting with the single TreeNode("root").
Just make sure the input and output of the program is exactly as
specified and fits with the  expected_out.txt when the tester
program is run with the original commands.txt.
Then feel free to make your own, more extensive tests.
